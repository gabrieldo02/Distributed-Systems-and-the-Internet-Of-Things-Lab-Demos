I have done labs working with things like Virtual Machines, Raspberry Pi, GrovePi sensors, TCP, UDP, Socket Programming, Web Services, MQTT, RESTful APIs, and Signal Processing. I took this class when I was still a computer engineering and computer science major before switching to a pure computer science major, so I have experience with these topics as well.
